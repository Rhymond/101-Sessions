# WeWork Spinningfields - Manchester

Office Space at No. 1 Spinningfields
Situated in the heart of Manchester's prime business and commercial district, WeWork Spinningfields spans 3 floors of the city's newest high-rise redefining the Manchester skyline.

This location - at the center of Hardman's Square - is at the hub of the new Manchester that businesses and entrepreneurs alike are looking for: steps from the city's best restaurants, bars, and galleries, look no further for a thriving coworking and private spaces to suit your business needs. With floor to ceiling windows, a pet-friendly policy, a lobby cafe, wellness rooms, plentiful meeting rooms and more - this Manchester community has all the amenities companies both large and small could ask for.

WeWork Spinningfields has its own private dedicated entrance to the street and is just moments from prime transport links including the Metrolink, Metroshuttle, and Greater Manchester Rail.

## Training Space

The 101 sessions will be mainly held on the mezzanine floor near the WeWork receptions desk. Just head to the desk and look for the meeting room behind and slightly to the right of the desk.

Infinity Works Manchester office is based in WeWork, so we should always be around to help people find the room. Please slack a message if you get lost.
