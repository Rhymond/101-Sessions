# 101-Sessions

This space is a work in progress for a project based out of Manchester. Code named "IW 101 Sessions" its a plan to gauge interest in providing evening professional training to the community.

The format is being designed by the community within following slack account : https://join.slack.com/t/man-tech

The aim is to firstly expose a new event format that might be more appealing to a section of the community. Sharing skills and topics that IW have experience in. This will in turn allow IW to upskill on hosting training and producing training material for new starters and graduate schemes. In addition it increases brand awareness and access to a talent pool.
